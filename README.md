# CASTOR-UVMOS - DQ & DZ White Dwarf Analysis

Using the CASTOR UVMOS Spectrograph ETC notebook, I created two new functions to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio for a given region and the equivalent width of a specified absorption line. 

I also created a notebook to study the synthetic spectra for DQ and DZ White Dwarf Stars to determine if the current resolution for CASTOR UVMOS would show that the selected stars are chemically enriched.
This notebook was designed to run through the different stellar types at different temperatures and abundances while calculating the signal-to-noise ratio (over the entire spectrum) and exposure time for specified wavelengths.

Please note that these notebooks were designed specifically for the included synthetic spectra and CASTOR UVMOS.
